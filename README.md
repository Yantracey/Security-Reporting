Reviewed three key security reports: Crowdstrike 2021 Global Threat Report , Akamai Security Year in Review 2020 and Verizon Data Breaches Investigation Report to gain a basic market understanding and develop critical cybersecurity skills. 

**Part 1: CrowdStrike Global Threat Report**

1. **Dominant Ransomware in Healthcare 2020:**
   - TWISTED SPIDER

2. **Pandemic-related eCrime Phishing Themes:**
   - Financial assistance and government stimulus packages - The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the United States Secret Service (USSS) warned Americans to be vigilant for criminal fraud related to economic impact payments distributed through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, especially through phishing emails and text messages aimed at stealing personal and financial information; they advised individuals to report suspicious communications, take necessary precautions to avoid becoming victims, and report incidents to appropriate authorities. Additionally, the U.S. Government and international partners increased distribution of threat intelligence and best practices to disrupt and deter criminal activities related to the pandemic (IRS, n.d.).
   - Tailored attacks against employees working from home – According to National Library Medicine (2022), phishing, a type of cyber-attack heavily based on social engineering, involved sending maliciously-designed messages that tricked victims into performing specific actions, often leading them to download malicious software or disclose sensitive information to attackers, with the attacks frequently impersonating legitimate entities; during the COVID-19 pandemic, phishing emails and messages were used to direct victims to fraudulent websites, resulting in financial fraud or malware installation for extortion purposes, making phishing a common entry point for various cyber-attack sequences.
   - Scams offering personal protective equipment (PPE) – According to FBI News (2020), the FBI noticed instances where state government agencies, attempting to buy personal protective equipment and medical equipment, had wired funds to fraudulent brokers and sellers, resulting in the loss of funds outside the reach of law enforcement. Pre-payment heightened the risk of buyer fraud and reduced recourse options. Potential warning signs of illegitimate offers to sell items included the seller initiating contact through difficult-to-verify channels, a lack of an existing business relationship, an inability to explain item origin or availability, a failure to verify the seller's legitimacy with the manufacturer, and unexplained urgency in fund transfers or last-minute changes in wiring instructions.

3. **Highest Number of Ransomware Data Extortion Operations:**
   - Industrial and Engineering sector (229 incidents)

4. **WICKED PANDA Origin and Activities:**
   - During 2020, Wicked Panda, a prolific cyber threat group – originated from China, engaged in Chinese state-sponsored espionage, conducted various campaigns using major vulnerability releases from the previous year, attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in Citrix NetScaler/Application Delivery Controller (ADC), a Cisco router, and Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central. The group typically employed spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments for initial compromise and, once gaining access to victim organizations, utilized more sophisticated Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) while targeting specific industries such as Banking/Finance, Healthcare, Telecommunications, and Utilities (Blue Voyant, 2020).

5. **First Ransomware Actor Using Data Extortion:**
   - OUTLAW SPIDER

6. **Access Broker Definition:**
   - Crowdstrike (2021) defines access brokers as threat actors who gain backend access to various organizations, selling this access on criminal forums or private channels, which enables faster and easier deployments for criminal malware operators and has become increasingly common among BGH actors and aspiring ransomware operators. These access brokers may use logs from information stealers to aid their operations and even purchase credentials from these logs to facilitate initial access.

7. **Credential-based Attack Explanation:**
   - Credential-based attacks involve stealing credentials to bypass security measures and gain access to critical data. Attackers commonly use sophisticated phishing techniques, particularly in corporate environments, to deceive employees and obtain valuable credentials. To defend against these attacks, security awareness training is essential, along with limiting corporate credentials to approved applications and employing security products that can prevent unauthorized usage. Implementing policy-based, multi-factor authentication at the network layer can further enhance security and stop credential-based attacks at various stages, from credential theft to the abuse of stolen credentials (Cyberpedia, 2023).

8. **Heavy Adoption of Data Extortion in Ransomware:**
   - TWISTED SPIDER — operators of Maze and Egregor ransomware — has been credited for the heavy adoption of the data extortion technique in 2020.

9. **Definition of DLS:**
   - A Dedicated Leak Site (DLS) refers to a website where data that has been illegally obtained from companies, which have declined to pay ransom demands, is publicly published (Cybersecurity Knowledge Hub, 2023).
Threat actors compromise data confidentiality to extort money from businesses, utilizing dedicated leak sites (DLSs) to publish sensitive information and coerce victims into paying ransoms. These leaks can result in severe consequences such as security breaches, identity theft, financial fraud, reputational damage, and legal ramifications, with the double extortion technique becoming increasingly prevalent, where ransomware operators encrypt data and publish it on DLSs to pressure victims into compliance even after ransom payment.

10. **Percentage of eCrime Intrusions in 2020 (Crowdstrike Falcon OverWatch):**
    - 79% of intrusions came from eCrime intrusions in 2020.

11. **Most Reported Criminal Adversary of 2020:**
    - WIZARD SPIDER

12. **Impact of SPRITE SPIDER and CARBON SPIDER on Virtualization Infrastructures:**
    - In 2020, both SPRITE SPIDER (operators of Defray777) and CARBON SPIDER (operators of DarkSide) targeted ESXi hosts with Linux versions of their ransomware families during BGH (Big Game Hunting) operations. This shift is significant as BGH actors historically had not targeted Linux, making ESXi a natural and attractive target due to its increasing usage in organizations, allowing ransomware operators to quickly encrypt multiple systems using valid credentials and exploit the lack of conventional endpoint protection on ESXi hosts (Crowdstrike, 2021).

13. **Role of an Enabler in eCrime Ecosystem:**
    - According to Crowdstrike (2021), Cybercrime enablers are essential individuals and organizations that offer services to support cyberattacks. Enablers play a crucial role in the eCrime ecosystem, providing capabilities to cybercriminals, such as malware-as-a-service, specialized delivery mechanisms, and selling initial access to other criminal actors. Other services include coders creating malicious software, vendors selling hacking tools and stolen data, educators sharing cybercrime techniques, and
moderators maintaining criminal infrastructure (Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, n.d.).

14. **Three Parts of eCrime Ecosystem (CrowdStrike):**
    - Access brokers, Enablers, and eCrime actors

15. **Malicious Code Exploiting SolarWinds Orion Vulnerability:**

    - December 2019

18. **Percentage of Phishing Kits Active for 20 Days or Less:**
    - More than 60%

19. **Definition of Credential Stuffing:**
    - Credential stuffing is a prevalent cyberattack where stolen usernames and passwords from one organization are used to access user accounts at another organization, often facilitated by password reuse. This type of attack is a significant contributor to data breaches, as a large percentage of people reuse passwords across multiple accounts, leading to numerous attempted credential stuffing incidents each day (Poza, 2023).

20. **Percentage of Compromised Gaming Industry Player Accounts:**
    - Over half of the frequent players reported their accounts being compromised, yet only one-fifth of them expressed concern about such occurrences.

21. **Three-Question Quiz Phishing Attack Explanation:**
    - The phishing scam dubbed "Three Questions Quiz" involved customized campaigns exploiting various commercial brands worldwide, particularly in retail, food and beverage, airline, and entertainment sectors, with each campaign initiating a short quiz asking users three questions related to the imitated brand. These attacks exploit users by offering quizzes in exchange for a "prize," leading to the theft of personal information (Katz, 2018).

22. **Prolexic Routed Defense Against DDoS Attacks:**
    - Prolexic Routed safeguards organizations from DDoS attacks by rerouting network traffic through Akamai scrubbing centers, filtering out malicious elements and allowing only clean traffic to pass. Akamai's security experts in the SOC customize proactive mitigation measures to instantly detect and halt attacks while performing live analysis of the remaining traffic to implement further mitigation if necessary (Ragan, 2020).

**Part 3: Verizon Data Breaches Investigation Report**

26. **Difference Between Incident and Breach:**
    - An incident is a security event that affects the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of an information asset. While a breach is an incident that leads to the confirmed disclosure of data to an unauthorized party, not just potential exposure (Verizon, 2021).

27. **Percentage of Breaches Perpetrated by External and Internal Actors:**
    - 70% of breaches were perpetrated by external actors from 2016-2019 and 80% in 2020.
    - 30% of breaches were perpetrated by internal actors from 2016-2017, It increased to over 30% in 2018 but then decreased to 30% in 2019. In 2020, the internal breaches stood at 20%.

28. **Percentage of Breaches Perpetrated by Organized Crime:**
    - 80% of breaches were perpetrated by organized crime.

29. **Financial Motivation in Breaches Over the Years:**
    - 2016: Approximately 67%
    - 2017: Approximately 82%
    - 2018: Approximately 75%
    - 2019: Approximately 92%
    - 2020: Approximately 100%

30. **Definitions (DoS, Command and Control, Backdoor, Keylogger):**
    - Denial of service: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks aim to compromise the availability of networks and systems, often targeting web servers of high-profile organizations like banking, commerce, and government entities. DoS attacks have two main methods: flooding services and crashing services. Flood attacks overwhelm the server with excessive traffic, leading to slowdowns or stoppages, and common types include buffer overflow attacks, ICMP floods (smurf attack or ping of death), and SYN floods. Alternatively, some DoS attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the target system or service, causing crashes or destabilization, making them inaccessible to legitimate users (Cyberpedia, 2023). Another form is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, where multiple systems coordinate to execute a synchronized attack on a single target. While DoS attacks do not typically lead to data theft, they can cause significant disruptions and financial costs for the victims (Cyberpedia, 2023).
    - Command and Control: A Command and Control (C2) attack is a damaging technique used by threat actors to communicate with compromised devices over a network, allowing them to deliver instructions for tasks such as downloading malware, creating botnets, or exfiltrating data. The attacker initiates the attack by infecting the target machine, using methods like phishing emails, exploiting security holes in browser plugins, or leveraging other infected software. Once communication is established, the attacker gains complete control of the victim's computer, allowing them to spread malicious code and create a botnet to further infiltrate the company network. Command and control (C2) is a crucial stage in the attack process, occurring before the threat actors achieve their objectives and bypassing existing security measures, making it vital for security professionals to detect and prevent C2 attacks promptly (Cyberpedia, 2023). There are different C2 tactics, including centralized, peer-to-peer (P2P), and random architectures, each with varying degrees of difficulty to detect and block. Security professionals need to be vigilant in detecting and
preventing C2 attacks, as they often occur after bypassing other security tools and can lead to complete control of a network (Cyberpedia, 2023). The MITRE ATT&CK framework outlines more than 16 command-and-control tactics employed by adversaries, encompassing various sub-techniques involving application layer protocols, data encoding, encrypted channels, proxies, remote access software, and other methods used to communicate, and control compromised devices (Cyberpedia, 2023).
    - Backdoor: According to Cyberhub (1994-2003), a backdoor is a method of bypassing an organization's security systems, allowing legitimate users or attackers to evade detection and gain unauthorized access to corporate systems. Backdoors can take various forms, such as trojans, built-in default accounts, web shells, and supply chain exploits, providing cybercriminals with remote access to execute malicious actions, steal sensitive data, deploy malware, or expand their capabilities on the system. Backdoors are typically employed to gain initial access to an organization's environment, either through discovered backdoors created by legitimate users or by exploiting vulnerabilities to deploy their own backdoors on systems. While some backdoors are intentionally inserted for legitimate purposes, they can become potential security risks when discovered by attackers, enabling unauthorized access and compromising system integrity (Cyberhub, 1994-2003).
    - Keylogger: Keyloggers, also known as keystroke loggers, are tools that record a user's keystrokes on a device, and while they have legitimate uses, they are often maliciously employed. In keylogger attacks, the software captures every keystroke and sends it to the attacker, potentially compromising sensitive information such as credit card details and passwords (Cybersecurity 101, 2023). Although keyloggers can be used legally for purposes like parental monitoring or employee productivity tracking, they are commonly utilized by cybercriminals to monitor user activity and commit cybercrimes, with infamous examples like the DarkHotel malware targeting users through unsecured hotel Wi-Fi (Cybersecurity 101, 2023). It is crucial to protect against keylogger attacks due to their ability to swiftly capture sensitive data, posing a significant cybersecurity threat. Understanding keyloggers, how to prevent attacks, and how to remove them if targeted is essential for safeguarding personal information (Cybersecurity 101, 2023).
